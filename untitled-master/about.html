          <p>
            I am currently studying Mathematics at the University of Hull. 
			I started to play around with designs in my spare time and decided to turn this into a small business. Now I sell my products in 8 outlets
            in Hull, Cottingham, Beverley & Little Weighton.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am currently looking into expanding using different materials to create a wider range of products. I deal in graphic design, designing prints, postcards, notebooks and mugs, and am currently venturing into textiles.
